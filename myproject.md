## Discover
Discover card launched in 1986 as part of Sears financial services. Greenwood trust company  which was acquired by Sears.
### Early History

Sears was the largest retailer in the US which looked to diversify into the realm of financial services. Allstate insurance, Dean witter financial services, coldwell banker real estate. With all that, Sears should have been the powerhouse for payments, insurance and real estate businesses. At that point most cards were branded charge cards which were to be used at specific businesses like Sears had its own card to use at the store allowing customers to be billed for their purchases later and perhaps enjoy some perks for their shopping loyalty. This began to change with the introduction of the diners club card in 1950. Diners club was a card that could be used as payment in an expanding number of restaurants, hotels, car rental agencies and in the like it really set the stage for what we think of as the modern credit card. American Express, already a long established company, got into the charge card game in 1959. Unfortunately for diners club banks would come together to form two separate payment networks of their own what we now know today as visa and mastercard.

Diners club international is actually owned by discover. In the 1980s we had various bank issued credit cards running on either the visa or mastercard networks and american express finding a niche by issuing its own charge cards catering to businesses or higher income consumers running the payments on a network that it owned. This was the basic state of the industry and what Sears was trying to break into with Discover card. Sears launching its own financial services brand anchored by a new branded credit card and doing it all on their own payments network outside of the big three.The amount of resources that it would take to make such a challenge successful could only come from a company like Sears at the time. Sears estimated that it would lose 115 million dollars on Discover for 1986. It did lose money on the venture in both 86 and 1987. Sears even initially launched Discover with no membership fee for cardholders plus they were only charging merchants who would accept the card 1.89 per transaction versus the higher rates of visa mastercard and american express. 

In 1993 Sears spun off dean witter discover into its own separate company ending its foray into the payment space allowing Discover card to try to succeed without being trapped in the orbit of a declining retail giant. Dean witter discoverer would eventually merge with morgan stanley which would then do a spin-off of discover in 2007. Pulse payments network greatly expanded their reach in the market. Finally on its own Discover financial services went public in 2007. Then the following year bought diners club international.

```
Two segments:
Digital banking
  Payments 
  Discover Network
  Pulse Network
  Diners club international 
```
When it comes to the network this is really where Discover competes with visa and mastercard as those two don't actually lend any money. A card issuer usually runs their credit card program on top of either visa or mastercard's own payment networks which is why you'll have something like a capital one branded mastercard. Each process transaction allows for these companies to collect a fee. The more transactions the more fees. Discover differs from visa and mastercard and is much more like american express is that they are both a card issuer and run their own payment network as such discover competes both with banks and the other payment processors. 

In 2018 the Discover global payments network did 376 billion in volume. In 2019 that number increased to 403 billion dollars in volume. Diners club still managed to do 34 billion dollars in transaction volume last year. Discover's overall transaction volume increased by 62 percent between 2010 and 2019. Working with other leading networks, banks and businesses Discover continued to build a robust global acceptance network which now includes more than 48 million merchant locations and approximately 2.2 million atms. 

Digital banking side of things Discover operates just like any other bank would just without the same branch locations. This is where they actually issue the physical credit and debit cards but also extend the credit when a Discover card is used. Discover IT card features a rotating spending category each quarter that gives users 5% cash back and 1% cash back on their other purchases. Discover is also involved in personal loans, student loans, savings, cds, checking accounts and home equity loans. How they make money from this segment is basically interest and various fees. A member agreement states the interest that we earn on revolving credit card balances makes up approximately 81 percent of the total interest income. We also charge customers other fees as specified in the card member agreements. These fees may include fees for late payments, return checks, balance transfer transactions and cash advance transactions. Most of the interest income comes from the personal and student loan offerings.

### **Achievement**
I'm actually impressed by how Discover has built and sustained for almost 39 years in the credit cards and payment space. Discover had to compete against the biggest financial institutions in the US who also had a few decades head start. Think of how massive an undertaking in terms of starting a brand from scratch, but also having to set up an independent payment network versus three competitors (VISA, MASTER and AMEX) who already dominated the globe not only Discover survived, they have grown a lot as a business since the early days. Discover didn't really work out for Sears but as an independent company it is now one of the biggest digital banks in the united states and the third most widely accepted credit card brand.

Proud to say my first credit card is Discover IT and I own shares in Discover. That’s how much I trust and  value the company.

### Future of discover

- let's briefly discuss what's currently
facing discover obviously
2020 has thrown a whole host of problems
at the company
transaction volume has been kneecapped
spending on travel is way down
interest rates are back around zero
hampering their banking business
then with massive unemployment defaults
on credit cards and their other loan
products
are going to be tough to get through
this is especially true for discover
which counts plenty of lower to middle
income americans as their customer base
plus their international operations
aren't large enough to offset any
negatives
here domestically this coming off of a
2019 that was pretty spectacular for the
company
the earnings per share last year was
nine dollars and eight cents
in the second quarter of 2020 they lost
one dollar
20 cents per share also they had to
provision
set aside two billion dollars for
potential loan losses
quite frankly if the economy doesn't
fully recover quickly the next few years
could be rough for discovered
luckily management learned a lot from
2008 2009
that whole financial crisis and built a
balance sheet that could weather a storm
and this one will definitely test the
brand while discover often gets
overlooked as a brand compared to visa
mastercard and american express

## Tell me about yourself

- My name is Teja Bandikalla. I’m currently working as Sr Software Engineer at Nordstrom for Payments and Securitization team. I have vast experience as a full stack web app developer and I enjoy working with all layers of the stack and solving complex problems. My passion for web app development started when I was doing my internship during my bachelors and I was given a solo project to work on for the entirety of the internship and this really gave me full ownership over everything from the design, decisions, to the actual coding of it. Starting with this, I was also able to gain a lot of experience and exposure to different tools and technologies. After my internship I decided that this is what I wanted to do as a career and pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science which helped me gain insight knowledge in the field I’m interested in. After my graduation, I worked as a Software Development Engineer for Columbia Pipeline Group in Charleston, WV. After that I worked for U.S.Bank, John Deere Financial. Before moving onto Nordstrom as a Sr Software Engineer - Seattle,WA. Overall I’ve been in the IT industry for about 9 years building out dozens of different applications and writing apis. Right now at my current company I'm helping out with the modernization of our existing infrastructure by following Event-Driven-Architecture (EDA) using Apache Kafka and Spring boot, This includes building out new microservices on Cloud platform using Openshift Kubernetes as well as updating existing technologies and supporting the payment platform that was delivered last year which was completely built from scratch. I've experience with Java, all of the Spring Modules, Spring MVC, Spring boot, Spring JPA, Hibernate, Rest & SOAP web services for building out apis at microservice architecture level as well as experience with various javascript frameworks including Jquery, angular and React. Dealt with different SQL DBs like Mysql, Postgres, oracle and sql server. Also Worked with HTML5, JSP, CSS, Bootstrap. JUnit for Integration & Unit Testing, JMeter for perfomance Tests, WireMock for Mocking API calls, Cucumber and RestAssured for Acceptance tests. We use openshift and kubernetes combo here and gradle for the build and Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). I worked in Agile teams during my career, We follow bi-weekly sprints. We'll have Standups/Huddle call every morning. Also we have Sprint Planning, Grooming, Retrospective, Backlog refinement and also Review
-  I applied to this role because the job description with the roles and responsibilities including the tech stack closely relates to what I’m doing here. I believe my experience that includes the financial tech domain and payments along with my passion would make me a great asset for your organization.

## Managerial Questions
### Tell me about a time you FAILED/MISTAKE at work and what did you learn from it?

> Tell me about a time you committed a MISTAKE?
> Have you ever failed at something? What did you learn from it?
- This was a while ago. One time I was assigned a task of implementing a new feature into one of our legacy applications and we used git as our source control. So as I was working on this feature, I was continuously pushing changes to our master branch which isn't good practice because you always want to keep your master branch deployable as well as in sync with what's in production. Also if we deployed this app with this feature being partially done it would break the application but this was an app that barely ever got updated. The last update was like 3-4 years ago. So I figured I'd be all right! but of course we had an emergency bug fix that had to be made and it was like we actually can't deploy it because the app is going to break. Luckily with GIT source control you are able to go back and cherry pick. we were able to add that change to where I started working on the feature. With this experience I learned that in future if i was going to make any changes, first create a branch off of master and deploy to that branch and then when you're finally done with the feature then merge the changes back into master. Here in the payments where I lead, this is the process my team has to follow. We either create a Branch or a fork off of develop branch, work on that feature commit and create a pull request for his/her local branch, then I have to review and approve which then will be merged to develop branch. Once verified, we move to QA where it requires two approvals for the pull request and 80% coverage from Sonar is mandatory.

### Unable to meet the DEADLINE

- When I was working for U.S.Bank, I think it was probably during the middle of my tenure, I worked on a requirement where I had to make a rest call and consume the json and display the results on the web application by rendering the data according to the business requirement. I gave it 3 weeks as my estimate to complete and deliver. The producer portion of the api wasn’t ready till 2 days before my deadline. it was a dependency on another team. Yet, I completed my part to api call to consume the data and the UI functionality. Once integrated, it was a failure. There were numerous issues that popped up. It was my estimate and lack of planning that caused it. After this incident in my career, I always gave myself buffer time and checked if there are any dependencies and if we are consuming data from another team,  whether it is ready or not. This helped me improve my estimation and planning portion when considering a deadline and I always think of providing the testing team with sufficient time.
---
### Tell me why you APPLIED for this role?

- Before applying for this role with Discover, I spent time reading the job description and the technology stack. I wanted to make sure I was both properly
qualified for the role, and that I also had the appropriate experience and skills to help
drive the company forward. I am hard working, driven, technically astute and someone who
will work closely with people within your organization to achieve your commercial and
financial objectives. I want to be an Application Engineer because it is a role that
I am extremely passionate about, and also one I get immense job satisfaction from, especially
when I get to see first-hand the positive contribution my work makes to the organization
I am working for. If you hire me as your software engineer, I will not only work hard to deliver
consistent positive results, but I will also use my developing, researching, analytical
and technical skills to help the company continually thrive and develop.
---
### Tell me a time when you worked AS PART OF TEAM/ LEADERSHIP to solve a complex task?

- I was the lead of the Digital Payments project 
application for NORDSTROM. Towards the end of the project, we encountered a number
of bugs and problems with the application, and time was against us to get everything
fixed before the deliverable date. I had the ownership and it was my responsibility to come up with
a solution to get the issues fixed. I stayed behind late that evening with two other 
team members to come up with a plan that would ensure the bugs were not only fully rectified,
but that a support system was in place to respond to any future issues if they were
to arise, post-handover. We started off by CREATING A LIST of all bugs and issues. We
then attempted to RECREATE EACH BUG so that we could assess what was causing the issue.
We managed to recreate all of the bugs and it was then my task to CREATE A TIMESCALE
for rectifying and testing each issue. Once we had a PLAN IN PLACE, we could then allocate
tasks to team members based on their area of technical competence the following morning.
By creating a plan of action, and by working closely together as a team, we were able to
tap into the combined team expertise and competence to not only provide a time-sensitive solution
to the problem, but to also implement a support mechanism for payments which was never thought of during the initial list of deliverables. Prioritizing and organizing really helped. 
---
### How would you HANDLE STRESS with your work?

- I think as a software engineer, you have to realize that stress and pressure is all part of the role. And in actual fact, I feel I tend to perform better when I am up against it and there is a definitive timeframe to
work towards. I manage stress in three ways. First and foremost, I ensure I plan my work
well in advance, so I know what I need to do, and by what deadline. By having a plan
in place, it means I work more efficiently and I can decide which tasks need my attention
first. The second way I handle stress and pressure, is to make sure I work closely with
other members of the team, and that communication is a constant theme throughout the day. Finally,
I handle stress and pressure by making sure I dedicate some time each week to keeping
up-to-date with developments from within the industry. This gives me the confidence in
my role as a Software Engineer, and it also eliminates any unwelcome surprises when updates
do come out or changes within the industry are released
---
### What is your WEAKNESS/STRENGTH?

- We all have weaknesses, and I know my own is the fact I find it really hard to strike a
healthy work-life balance. I love my job as a software engineer, and I used to spend a lot of extra hours looking after my work by trying to improve or organize and optimize the work I’ve done. Once I'm done with my work, even when I am not at work, I am usually spending time with computer systems, learning new technologies, reading about new gadgets, developing additional skills and qualities so I continue to grow in the role. I continued this till date. This is an area I have been working to improve upon, and I am trying to spend more time with my friends & family. Conversely, one of my strengths is the fact I am always prepared to listen to feedback, and I do genuinely want to improve and develop as a person on both a personal and a professional level.

### Give an example of when you saw a peer STRUGGLING and decided to step in and help. 
> What was the situation and what actions did you take?
> What was the outcome? name time when you went out of your way to help someone?

- I was working on a memory leak that was reported by Datadog that we had configured. For anyone who's a software engineer knows those two words are devastating to hear, makes every developer, manager and cto very sweaty and nervous and so for about a 3-4 days or roughly a week I spent all my time really focused on why we were having this memory leak and We weren’t able to reproduce this sandbox environment. There was a new developer who recently joined that team who was given KT and had little understanding of the project. He is the on call person during this holiday season as the one who supposed to be on call had a family emergency. it turns out a configuration file had been changed by rating service team. I don't have a way of seeing it because the service was written by another team in Node JS and it’s a maven project. When I figured out it was the rating service api causing the issue, sent an email to their support team to look into and things escalated pretty fast but he couldn’t figure out where the issue was as he was new. To speed up things I had set up their maven project in my local. So I had my application running on 8080 and theirs on 8081. On the 6th attempt, my console painted the logs with memory leak. By then I had added logs all over my project and their project. So I identified this area was like well wait a second did this change, how much memory do we have here for the green cluster and they said oh we have this much i said oh no we're expecting to have three times that much and so because of that our servers were crashing and restarting over and over. so identified it rolled out a fix and we went from like a thousand errors a day to zero

## CONFLICT
### Tell me about a situation where you had a CONFLICT/ Team's TRUST with someone on your team. What was it about? What did you do? How did they react? What was the outcome?

> Tell me about a time when you earned your teammate's TRUST?
> Tell me about a time when your teammate didn't agree with you? What did you do?
> Time when you came up with a novel solution.

- I had a conflict with my product owner. Around the same time we had a team reshuffle where our existing manager got promoted to a Sr IT manager and a lot of team members moved under him due to the Statement of Purpose contract. Initially the payment project was supposed to be worked on by 3 existing Senior Developers including me, The other developer has left Nordstrom and it was my responsibility to take up the design and implementation. Revamp the payment processing to the entirety and connect to Stripe network instead of the old Bill trust network with which the contractual agreement will be terminated by end of December 2022. I came up with a design to have the payment module as a separate project rather than changing every time the financial vendor has to be switched. Our product owner did not agree because of the tight deadline, less resources we’re having. I understood his perspective and explained to him the pros of my approach. yet He insisted me to go with else condition on the overall project. I scheduled an immediate meeting with my new manager and the leadership about my approach and design. I provided a roadmap on how this can be achieved and how much it is beneficial in the long term. We got instant funding for this and 3 new developers got hired depending on the requirement of what I asked for. We worked hard and overtime to deliver it. It was a grand success and I got huge appreciation for it in the form of an award. We always had issues and the enrollments were getting rejected because of payment issues. With this architecture and new design, we haven’t had a single issue so far due to payments with which I earned my product owners trust. Any new requirement comes in, he now looks strictly for me
---
### How would you deal with a MEMBER of your team who DISAGREED with the work you carried out as a software engineer? 

- I have a lot of experience in programming and also the way I take things forward with my work, and I feel the work I produce is to a very high standard. Having said that, I am also aware that when I do work as part of a team, it is important to listen to other people as they may have valid contributions to make. In my day-to-day routine, I push code and create Pull Requests. My code gets reviewed, commented and will be given feedback. There will be times of disagreement. On that basis, I would certainly be open to listening to why they felt the work I was carrying out could be altered or improved. At the end of the day, we are all working for the same organization, and if it means changing the way I do things for the benefit of the team goal, I will certainly do that.
---
### Time when you went above and BEYOND YOUR JOB responsibilities?

- We had an offshore prod support team of 2 where one of the team members tested positive for Covid. The other had to be quarantined. So we don’t have anyone to take care of critical issues. I volunteered to be on call for support. Initially it was a mess as I was the only one and had to work in the morning and get on call during night whenever there’s an issue as most of the developers are on vacation. Once we had a dev who returned from vacation, I requested my manager and spoke to the other dev and we came up with a schedule and took turns accordingly till the offshore team returned to normal. I was able to jump in help when the team was in dire need and was successful at it.
---
### Time when you HELPED someone grow in career and it benefited them.

- We had a recent grad who joined as a tester. Her job was to test the payment module which was developed by me where she constantly comes back to me with a bunch of issues and when I try to reproduce, they tend to work as expected. As far as I remember I reject 90% of the defects. She still comes back the next day with a bunch of “not a defect” version of defects the next morning in the stand up. I can sense that my manager got concerned about the UAT deadline when she said “Teja can you take up this as priority and resolve all the defects by EOD”. So I had a one on one with the tester and explained to her the business and process of the module in detail. She was more like the field doesn’t have all the drop down values and few options were not showing up where they should show up because according to the filter and prior selection before coming to this search module that’s how it is supposed to work. She took the notes of everything and from then on she started understanding the business before directly jumping on to testing. I believe this has helped her in the long tem and you know what...she is now a BSA who writes stories and I can tell for sure as she gains a few more years of experience, she will become a product owner.

### ACHIEVEMENT
- There are many achievements throughout my career. But what makes me really happy is if my work has any meaningful impact to the end users of my applications or APIs and the business. The recent one I would say that gave me immense satisfaction is migrating from an old billtrust payment network to a new Stripe payment network. We completely revamped our screens using ReactJS while achieving it. There are many components and dependent APIs involved in a single transaction to process. Doing this, drastically reduced the TPS(throughput/transaction per second) to less than 1 second. To compare I would say upgrading from iPhone 10 to iPhone 15 Pro Max(I’m pretty sure the that’s latest iteration of iPhone). When we did performance testing using jmeter in uat environment before me moving it to prod, I instantly noticed a huge difference in the numbers. This is a huge win for our team in terms of tech perspective
---
### Tell me about a time when you LEARNED NEW technology

- React, Cucumber .ReactJS: Creating custom components using react hooks. Axios library for making API calls. Cucumber used automatic test cases. Used Gherkin syntax with Given when then statements for writing automation tests for API.
Our data center lately had too many issues. Be it connectivity or servers being restarted. So the leadership decided to move to the cloud platform. Our code base is huge and it’s a big monolithic application. So we were told to look at 3 options. Cloud foundry, Microsoft Azure and AWS. We chose AWS because it has more support be it from AWS support, from the blogs, articles, AWS documentation and internet and few teams in the organization have already implemented it. Initially it was hard for us when we started to migrate. We were barely able to complete 1 story in 15 days and we even thought is the migration necessary at one point and as we learned and tried to understand the core concepts and how the services can be used, we completed 5 stories in the next 15 days. So far we have used EC2 (VM), S3 (Media, posts, documents), Lambdas (microservices), elastic search (to look for applications like a tool for the DB where we already have data ready), cloudwatch (logs), api gateway (expose those service endpoints). Been at where I was back then I’m now happy to say that I completed my AWS developer certification which helped me envision it as the future of where the technology is moving.

### DECISION on your OWN without managers approval

- Every year we have a Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, starting July 15th and also there is an early access on July 9th for Ambassador and Icon status exclusive customers - who also have Nordstrom credit card. I was the release lead - to look after the jenkins deployment where we take in user traffic. We delivered everything as initially planned and it was a smooth release on June 15th. We switched everything to 2022 Annual Event Promotion(AEP) settings on June 8th midnight. Most of the folks on our team wouldn’t be present for that. My manager was off during that period due to a family emergency but she was there for the critical release. I’m well aware there will be a lot of user traffic on July 9th as it is the first day based on the previous years experience. So we have to scale up and increase the pods in openshift from 8 to 16 to handle the traffic which is just the configuration that needs to be approved. Tried calling her because it’s critical. Left her a text and email regarding the same and I scaled up the pods. The next morning as expected, we had thrice the volume of user traffic we normally had and my critical decision in time saved the day. Else pods would have been overloaded and crashed. On that evening my manager called me and appreciated my forward thinking about the decision I took.
---
### CUT CORNERS to meet deadline

- Every year we get regulations about new infections or diseases and things we will have to incorporate accordingly in our application. This year we received regulations as usual. I looked through the list and as everyone is aware, implemented COVID regulation as soon as possible within the next few days. Like expected this became the highest priority from business point of view and has more weight than any other regulation according to business later on and we delivered it in time. If I had worked on picking up the stories or tasks for the other regulations and implemented it, that would have been very late in reacting to COVID.
---
### POC

- We always receive complaints from the testing team that something is down, something is not working as expected. When I had time during last November, I wrote a Selenium script with customized modules for our API. This automated the submission process of an application which I run every morning ever since to make sure all the apis and pages are working as expected. This did cut down testing time a lot. 
### Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm

- Docker runs on a single node, whereas Kubernetes is designed to run across a cluster. 
**Why do you like working here?**
Why are you bringing in Lead Software Engineer? Anyone left or anyone promoted or expanding the team?
What has frustrated you about software engineers you have employed in the past? 
Docker engine the runtime allows you to build and run containers. In order to build a container you need docker file which has to be configured with all network and OS specification to run the image. Docker image runs on docker engineer.
To scale run and monitor the health of the application we use kubernetes basically for the orchestration purpose.

### QUESTIONS TO ASK 
- I want to know the Bussiness, Team structure - As you said we're having Spring Data JPA, are we having anyone from DB side on our Team, or should we communicate with an external DB team to have data. Tester

###
